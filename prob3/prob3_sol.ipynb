    "First, let's review what the A3C algorithm is. \n",
    "\n",
    "A3C stands for **Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic**. Let's break it down:\n",
    "1. **Aysnchronous:** One key advantage of A3C is the comparative speed at which is can be trained compared to other DeepRL methods like DQN. The secret to this speed is a parallelized approach. In A3C, several worker agents are working in parallel on their own individual, local copies of the environment. After several steps, the worker agents update their local models, and then compare their local models to the single global model. If any individual worker has made an improvement to the global model, the global model is updated and all the asynchronous workers synchronize their local models to the new global model. This approach means we can benefit significantly from the speedups in parallel computation. You will learn much more about parallelization in CS 61C!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advantage:** As you have learned, Advantage is defined as the difference between a better Q-state and the Value of a state per an existing policy. That is: $$A(s, a) = Q(s, a) - V^\\pi(s)$$ A3C focuses on estimating the advantages of actions, instead of trying to specifically determine the individual Q-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Actor-Critic:** The Actor-Critic model is a typical setup for DeepRL, in which an Actor tries to determine the best action from a given state, and in which a Critic evaluates the chosen action for long-term reward. Usually, the Critic is estimating the Value of the state achieved after taking the action. However, in A3C, the Critic instead estimates the Advantage of the state-action pair from the Actor. The interplay between Actor and Critic helps the system converge faster and achieve better results than either system alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a high-level understanding of what A3C is, let's get into the details and start implementing it!"
